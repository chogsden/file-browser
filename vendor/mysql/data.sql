Both are marine cephalopods (molluscs with a prominent head attached to equally prominent tentacles) and distantly related to squid and cuttlefish. This fossil\'s name, Australiceras, suggests that it belongs to a type that also occurs in Australia, showing that these animals were free swimming across the globe.

This dancer also wears Inuit snowgoggles, known as iggaak. \n\nThe style of Inuit sculpture from Qamanittuaq (\'where the river widens\') – on the northwest shore of Baker Lake, near the geographical centre of Canada – is dictated by the hard, grey or green–black local stone. Many of the sculptors of this area produce work that is very rounded, with silhouettes whose curves are reinforced by the internal, rhythmic movement of sleeves, legs, and other details. Drum Dancer is an example in Akilak\'s work of the smoother features typical of the preeminent Baker Lake carvers.

But, for some, the exciting discovery was not the skill of Praxiteles but the handsomeness of Hermes. Dionysus could be dispensed with – and was.

Probably for the first time, it was proven that intervention in a pristine ecosystem could lead to the extinction of an entire species of animal.\n\nThe Museum has a large quantity of bone material from Mauritius thanks to Alfred Newton, Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy from 1866–1907, and his brother Edward, a colonial administrator on the island. The brown–stained bones of this composite dodo skeleton were wired together under Alfred\'s direction. They were gathered by islanders, mostly from a swamp called Mare aux Songes (\'Sea of Dreams\').\n\nDNA analysis has established that the dodo\'s nearest living relative is a species of south–east Asian pigeon species, whose ancestors travelled south across the ocean via a chain of now–vanished islands, only to lose the power of flight on reaching Mauritius.

In 1910 he joined Scott’s British Antarctic Expedition as geologist and made extensive surveys of the mountains and glaciers west of McMurdo Sound, using a plane table as a solid surface for drawing in the field. He was made responsible for the expedition’s photography when the official photographer, Herbert Ponting, left in 1912. On his return to England, Debenham was invited to Cambridge to write up the scientific results, but his work was interrupted by the First World War. Returning to Cambridge after demobilisation, he resumed work on the expedition reports on geology and maps and surveys.

The new Sedgwick Museum, named after him, was built to house the collection and was opened in 1904. The artist portrays Sedgwick standing in front of a geological map; the previous year Sedgwick had tutored the young Charles Darwin in the techniques of geological mapping, before Darwin set sail on HMS Beagle on 27th December 1831. The two kept up a correspondence but when Sedgwick read Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), he commented that it was with \'more pain than pleasure\' because Sedgwick, as a theological geologist, was fundamentally opposed to the idea of evolution.','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(46,'museum_2/object_3','object_3','35','image','museum_2',46,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','url','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(47,'museum_2/object_3','object_3','accession_number','text','museum_2',47,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','PD.52–1973','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(48,'museum_2/object_3','object_3','description','text','museum_2',48,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','This painting celebrates the achievements of Sir Isaac Newton as part of a speculative series of imaginary tomb monuments to illustrious Britons. It was Newton, fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University, who first explained the scientific nature of light in his Opticks of 1704. While this painting refers to his discoveries – a prism and a beam of light, central to Newton\'s experiments, cuts across the canvas – the light is in fact scientifically incorrectly coloured. The project allowed for further artistic license: an enormous urn within the Valeriani brothers\' fantasy church setting and an entourage of allegorical mourners, some long–dead historical figures, by Pittoni. The fact that the painting was commissioned by an Irish playwright, Owen McSwiny, perhaps accounts for this somewhat theatrical interpretation of the loss to humankind of a pioneer of scientific endeavour.','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(49,'museum_2/object_4','object_4','36','image','museum_2',49,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','url','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(50,'museum_2/object_4','object_4','accession_number','text','museum_2',50,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','MS.CFM.31.5','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(51,'museum_2/object_4','object_4','description','text','museum_2',51,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(52,'museum_2/object_5','object_5','37','image','museum_2',52,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','url','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(53,'museum_2/object_5','object_5','accession_number','text','museum_2',53,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(54,'museum_2/object_5','object_5','description','text','museum_2',54,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','10 butterflies, including models and mimics.\nThese specimens were used by Reginald Punnett, co–discoverer of genetic linkage and the first Professor of Genetics at Cambridge, for one of the colour plates in Mimicry in Butterflies (1915). Punnett\'s book summarised what was known about the ability of a harmless species of butterfly to mimic another and thus avoid becoming prey. It provided clear evidence of the struggle to incorporate the recent rediscovery of Mendelian genetics (the work of Gregor Johann Mendel) with Darwinian natural selection. Punnett thought that mimicry could not have come about entirely by the operation of natural selection (the gradual accumulation of many small changes), but that it had to be started by a sudden \'sport\' or mutation.\n\nThese specimens neatly illustrate his ideas. The two presumably undesirable Danaine butterflies at the top are mimicked by the females of three other totally different species. According to Punnett, and most other geneticists of the period, this could only have happened by the sudden appearance – independently in each species – of a sport which looked reasonably like the model. The modern view would be that this process is entirely consistent with Darwinian natural selection.','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(55,'museum_2/object_6','object_6','38','image','museum_2',55,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','url','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(56,'museum_2/object_6','object_6','accession_number','text','museum_2',56,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','PD.54–1999','2015-12-08 11:46:36','2015-12-08 11:46:36'),(57,'museum_2/object_6','object_6','description','text','museum_2',57,'http://localhost/file-directory/collections/museum 2/_content/','James Nasmyth, the Scottish engineer and inventor of the Steam Hammer, had a passion for astronomy.

IceCube – which looks very different to most telescopes we are familiar with – is designed to detect neutrinos released from the highest–energy cosmic activity; it can be used to study the core of the sun, the centres of supernovae and objects so distant that light from them is radically diminished.\n\nDetecting neutrinos – particles with negligible mass and no electrical charge – is singularly difficult. Unlike light particles, neutrinos do not generally interact with matter or physical forces. When they encounter water molecules in ice, they may decay, emitting a brief flash of light which the DOMs can then detect up to 100m away because of ice\'s transparency and low radioactivity.\n\nEach detector is nicknamed with a reference to J.K.

Drum Dancer is an example in Akilak\'s work of the smoother features typical of the preeminent Baker Lake carvers.
